    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The Francesinha is a Portuguese sandwich that originates from Porto. The literal translation for its name is ‘Little French Girl’, however, the only thing little about it, is the name. It’s a rather large sandwich filled with layers of beef steak, cured meat, fresh sausages, topped with cheese, covered with a beer sauce, and surrounded by French fries. It’s a meat and carb heavy meal that is believed to be a Portuguese adaptation of the French classic, the Croque-Monsieur. Multiple cafés, restaurants, and bars claim the title of having the best francesinha in Porto and it’s a hotly contested title.</p>
